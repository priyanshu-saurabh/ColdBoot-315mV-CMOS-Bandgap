# 315 mV CMOS Reference With Autonomous Cold-Boot


---

## Overview  
NanoVolt-BGR is a **low-voltage CMOS bandgap reference (BGR)** designed to operate at **supply voltages below 1 V** while maintaining **high power supply rejection ratio (PSRR)**.  
This project provides a **stable, precise, and energy-efficient voltage reference** for analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits operating under **strict power constraints**.

The design is particularly suited for:  
- Ultra-low power systems  
- Energy-constrained sensor nodes  
- Mixed-signal SoCs  
- Next-generation analog front-ends
